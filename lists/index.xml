      <description>A list of things I consumed and enjoyed in 2020 (even if they came out long before then!)&#xA;The rule was they had to come freely, if I had to remind myself what I had read/seen/watched/done then it wasnâ€™t good enough to feature in this list.&#xA;Best Books Overstory - Trees, People and Prose Giovannis Room - The secret worlds shared by two people Exit West - A refugee fairy tale Extreme Ownership - Motivates you to do a great job Bullshit Jobs - Reminds you about bullshit jobs!</description>
