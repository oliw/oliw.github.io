      <description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1463569814l/27161156.jpg&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Hillbilly-Elegy-Memoir-Family-Culture/dp/0062300547&#34;&gt;Hillbilly Eligy&lt;/a&gt; by J. D. Vance is a memoir of a boy growing up in Ohio in a [sic] white working class family that had its fair share of hardship and troubles with addiction. Its written very straightforwardly and conjures a vivid picture of the author&amp;rsquo;s upbringing. I read this book because it was being billed online as a good insight into a part of America that had been out of sight and out of mind. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this wholly explains why the &amp;lsquo;16 election swung the way it did but nevertheless a worthwhile read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
