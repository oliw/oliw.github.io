    <p>Since 2016 I&rsquo;ve logged about 2000 notes into my Notes app and a few nights ago I decided to have a clean up. Most of the notes could obviously be thrown out (shopping lists etc) but I decided about 150 were worth hanging onto! Many of those were clippings and excerpts from reading things online.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://luttig.substack.com/p/timeful-advice">how timeless is timeless advice?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each dollar of net income should be an investment in yourself with asymmetric upside. And investments don‚Äôt always look like investments: books and educational content are low cost but have asymmetric upside. Similarly, investing in your sleep setup or home office has compounding returns.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why it still resonates: I find myself in a society trying to doing more with less.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://annehelen.substack.com/p/consider-the-quasi-commune">consider the quasi-commune</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We spend so much time wishing for dominion over our own spaces and lives and forget just how lonely it can be once we arrive there.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why it still resonates: I bought a cabin in the woods and it was an exciting but solitary dream to fulfill.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44">Joe Rogan Experience #1309‚Äã - Naval Ravikant</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are Communists to our family, Socialists to our friends, Capitalists to strangers</p></blockquote>
<p>Why it still resonates: I&rsquo;m still struggling to reconcile the Individualism I witness where I live</p>
<p>From <a href="http://mindingourway.com/desperation/">Desperation</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain type of vulnerability that comes with committing your whole self to something. Our culture has strong social stigmas against people who really unabashedly care about something.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why it still resonates: I&rsquo;d rather not be overly cynical or belittling of someone&rsquo;s obsession or ambition.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-quit-their-jobs-at-dream-companies-like-Facebook-or-Google-1?share=1">Why do people quit their jobs at dream companies like Facebook or Google?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My guess is that you are operating under a set of assumptions that I&rsquo;ll call the Big Lie. The Big Lie goes something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work really hard at school,</li>
<li>So you can get good grades,</li>
<li>So you can go to a good university,</li>
<li>So you can get a really good job,</li>
<li>At a really good company,</li>
<li>Your family, friends, and potential mates will be impressed,</li>
<li>And you&rsquo;ll live happily ever after.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Why it still resonates:</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/30/financial-regulations-wall-street-sec-gamestop/">Washington Post Op-Ed on Gamestop</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The result is an oversize and overcompensated financial market that has long since abandoned its role to channel savings to the highest and best use, becoming nothing more than a high-tech casino.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why it still resonates: I feel like there is still so much greed and frantic lottery ticket grabbing going on.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HEn2qiMxk5BggN83J/boring-advice-repository">The Boring Advice Repository</a></p>
<p>Pretty much everything</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/2021-predictions-person-of-the-year/">Scott Galloway&rsquo;s 2021 Predictions</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>2021 is the year that a new firm joins Uber, Lyft, and Facebook in the Menace Economy (the pursuit of wealth at the expense of other human beings). That menace is online trading app Robinhood.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why it still resonates: Theres still so much greed going on</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Live-24-Hours-Day/dp/1618956647">How to Live on 24 Hours a Day</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good novel rushes you forward like a skiff down a stream, and you arrive at the end, perhaps breathless, but unexhausted.</p></blockquote>
<p>From <em>Unknown</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the modern workplace you can put in a full 8 hour day, be genuinely exhausted, and¬†not have produced anything whatsoever.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why it still resonates: Its an all-too-common risk as an engineer working on tricky things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The shortest distance between two points is reliably a straight line. If your dreams are apparent to you, pursue them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why it still resonates: Sometimes the most obvious route is the best route</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creating optionality and buying lottery tickets are not weigh stations on the road to pursuing your dreamy outcomes. They are dangerous diversions that will change you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why it still resonates: My society is addicted to lottery culture</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Treat people like you‚Äôll know them for the next ten thousand years and work on the kinds of projects you‚Äôll be proud to tell your grandchildren about.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why it still resonates: Its a great ideal!</p>
