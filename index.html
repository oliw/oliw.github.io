        Growing up in the 90s and early 00s, I feel like technology and I both had our growth spurts at the same time.
Today I’m almost 30, and technology is omnipresent and software is eating the world as Marc Andersson would put it. Technology is a force, but whether or not it’s a good force I think really depends on who you are, and what the timespan is that you’re evaluating.

        In this post, I show how to better protect your python service when making http calls to other services by guaranteeing a timeout by monkey-patching the requests library.
Services tend to talk to other services. These services might be owned by you, another team at work, or made available by a third party (e.g. Google Maps API).
How tolerant is your service to the failure of one of these upstream services?

        The morning of my flight home for the holidays I hastily came up with something for my family&rsquo;s arts&rsquo;n&rsquo;crafts gift exchange.
Luckily the Techshop was pretty quiet so I could get some time on the Laser Cutter to draw up these fellas
  It took three iterations to get it right, the first was too big, the second was good but needed handles. Once you&rsquo;ve got it though, its just a question of copy and paste to make lots!

        Late November I made this Wooden Dowel Christmas Tree with advent-style felt ornaments (with some talented friends helping with all the ornaments).
The tree is collapsible (you just pull the branches out) which is useful for the rest of the year when its not Christmas!
    Lessons learned  Dowel is cheap 25 hand-stiched ornaments can take a while Once you&rsquo;re half way through you have to finish!

        Update Now available on the App Store!
Even Steven is a handy app that records group spending for events such as holidays and suggests who needs to pay what to whom in order to get even!
Even Steven is designed for iPhone and:
 requires no signing up does not require an internet connection (ideal when holidaying abroad and not having data)  Behind the scenes, Even Steven is a pure Swift3 iOS app and uses no third party libraries.

        Tensorflow seems like a pretty exciting alternative to scikit-learn that works just as effectively for beginners as it does for pros.
For my team&rsquo;s monthly drink&rsquo;n&rsquo;sync I wrote an interactive worksheet on using TensorFlow to build a handwritten number detector.
Check it out on github!
